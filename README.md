## üìú ToDo
> **Disclaimer:** not everything will be added, but also some new stuff may come up
  - Try to add a possibility of recieving duels in the text-channels (on servers) instead of dms [The player would be able to choose]
  - Improve UI (make it nicer, like it's good but still there is room for some improvement)
  - Get current players on the channel where command is executed
  - Allow Administrators to delete games (sometimes smth can bug out)
    - if Admin deletes a game in which he is, then he automatically loses the game
    - Add karma system that is based on reaction to the deletion of game by administrator:
      - Admin starts with 5 karma
      - if Admin has less than 0 karma, then he can't delete games
      - Karma is server based
      - After deletion (if it was deleted by admin that was not one of the players) a form is sent, containing upvote, downvote, and na
      - Upvote gives karma to an Admin, Downvote, removes, na(no-action) does nothing
> **Very Low** probability for karma system
  
  - **Systems that lower toxicity**:
  - Add a time system that 
    - is a clock or:
    - naturally deletes game after some time around (45 min, 1h 15min)
